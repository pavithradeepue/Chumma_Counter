# Chumma Counter: The World's Most Pointless Bookmark üìñü§ñ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: GP

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Gokul P - Adishankara Institute of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Why write down your page number like a 15th-century monk when you can summon the power of React, Firebase and an ESP32? This marvel of modern overengineering exists solely to show you the page number of a book where you could easily just use a piece of paper or fold the corner as a bookmark.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Remembering your page number is too basic. Bookmarks are boring, and folding pages is a crime. Clearly, what we need is a smart, Firebase-connected, ESP 32-powered solution.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Slap an ESP32 into a breadboard, connect it to Firebase, build a Web app, and voil√† üéâ your page number is now in the cloud. Totally unnecessary, wildly overengineered, and somehow... beautiful.

Our system Uses a ESP 32 take input from the user (It is a  counter with 3 inputs Increment,Decrement and Upload). When the upload is Pushed the value is send to the Firebase DB . Then Our front end displays it (In the front end there is no way to modify the value only to view it). The Front end is hosted on Firebase. 

For Hardware:

We use a ESP-32 with a I2C oled display and 3 push buttons (Increment,Decrement,Upload), The esp keeps a counter which gets initilialized with a value from DB and When pressed upload it uploads it to the DB

We started building our hardware first then Our Database. after getting both to be running perfectly we built the front end website

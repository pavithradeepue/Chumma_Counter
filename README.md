# Chumma Counter: The World's Most Pointless Bookmark üìñü§ñ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: GP

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Gokul P - Adishankara Institute of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Why write down your page number like a 15th-century monk when you can summon the power of React, Firebase and an ESP32? This marvel of modern overengineering exists solely to show you the page number of a book where you could easily just use a piece of paper or fold the corner as a bookmark.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Remembering your page number is too basic. Bookmarks are boring, and folding pages is a crime. Clearly, what we need is a smart, Firebase-connected, ESP 32-powered solution.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Slap an ESP32 into a breadboard, connect it to Firebase, build a Web app, and voil√† üéâ your page number is now in the cloud. Totally unnecessary, wildly overengineered, and somehow... beautiful.

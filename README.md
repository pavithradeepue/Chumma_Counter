# Chumma Counter: The World's Most Pointless Bookmark üìñü§ñ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: GP

### Project Description
Why write down your page number like a 15th-century monk when you can summon the power of React, Firebase and an ESP32? This marvel of modern overengineering exists solely to show you the page number of a book where you could easily just use a piece of paper or fold the corner as a bookmark.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Remembering your page number is too basic. Bookmarks are boring, and folding pages is a crime. Clearly, what we need is a smart, Firebase-connected, ESP 32-powered solution.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Slap an ESP32 into a breadboard, connect it to Firebase, build a Web app, and voil√† üéâ your page number is now in the cloud. Totally unnecessary, wildly overengineered, and somehow... beautiful.

## Technical Details

## üíª Software Components

### Technologies Used

* **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
* **CSS**: Styling and visual presentation of the user interface.
* **JavaScript**: Client-side logic for dynamic content, animations, and Firebase integration.
* **Firebase Realtime Database**: Cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing and synchronizing the global page count.
* **Firebase Hosting**: Web hosting service for deploying the web application.

### Installation & Deployment

To set up and deploy the Chumma Counter web application:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/pavithradeepue/Chumma_Counter](https://github.com/pavithradeepue/Chumma_Counter)
    cd Chumma_Counter
    ```
2.  **Add Firebase Project:**
    ```bash
    firebase use --add
    ```
    Follow the prompts to select and associate your Firebase project.
3.  **Initialize Firebase Hosting:**
    ```bash
    firebase init hosting
    ```
    Configure the hosting settings as prompted (e.g., public directory, single-page app redirects).
4.  **Deploy to Cloud:**
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```
    This command builds and deploys your web application to Firebase Hosting.
5.  **Run Locally (for development):**
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start
    ```
    This will start local Firebase emulators for testing before deployment.

### Access the Live Website

You can access the deployed Chumma Counter website at:

## üîå Hardware Components

### Technologies/Components Used

* **ESP32**: Microcontroller for processing inputs and communicating with Firebase.
* **I2C OLED Display**: For visual feedback or displaying the current count on the hardware side.
* **Wires**
* **Wirecutter**
* **Wire Stripper**

### Implementation

1.  **Connect the Circuit:**
    Follow the provided schematic diagram to correctly connect the ESP32, I2C OLED, and any other relevant components using the wires. Ensure proper power supply and data lines (SDA/SCL for I2C).
2.  **Program ESP32:**
    Upload the `microcode.cpp` program to your ESP32 board using your preferred ESP32 development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO). This code handles reading the "chumma" inputs and updating the Firebase Realtime Database.

Our system Uses a ESP 32 take input from the user (It is a  counter with 3 inputs Increment,Decrement and Upload). When the upload is Pushed the value is send to the Firebase DB . Then Our front end displays it (In the front end there is no way to modify the value only to view it). The Front end is hosted on Firebase. 

For Hardware:

We use a ESP-32 with a I2C oled display and 3 push buttons (Increment,Decrement,Upload), The esp keeps a counter which gets initilialized with a value from DB and When pressed upload it uploads it to the DB
